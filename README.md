# Solving Linear Programming problems using the Transportation Model
This project solves linear programming problems to optimality as taught to us by **Prof. Assad El Nidani** in the Quantitative Business Analysis course as part of the MBA program.
I want to thank him personally for tolerating my endless questions and thoroughly answering them.
## Disclaimer
This code is not a clean code, it's just something that I threw together in my spare time because I was bored and curious :D and was tested on very limited cases. so use it at your own risk

## Example

### Transport model (table form)

### Entering the problem data
we need to set 3 variables: \
**cost**: determines the cost of every cell, values entered as list of rows, and each row has the list of cell cost values \
**supply**: used to assign the values of supply \
**demand**: used to assign the values of demand \
